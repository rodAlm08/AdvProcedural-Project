# AdvProcedural-Project
XYX Medical Supplier Ltd currently manually store client record but have requested you to 
develop a new client record application for them.

- This program will create a database which will store the details of all the client in the 
company. In addition to storing all the client data the application should allow overall client
statistics to be generated.
- Your program should create the database (which for your purpose MUST be implemented 
as a linked list) and be able to save, restore, retrieve, add, delete and update client details.
- The system is password protected and only the correct username and password details will 
allow the user to gain access to the system
